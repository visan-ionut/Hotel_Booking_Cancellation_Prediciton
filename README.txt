Info: This paper is a contribution to the work of Farzad Nekouei.
The study is based on his work and includes stages of data analysis and preprocessing.
The data is originally from the article "Hotel Booking Demand Datasets," written by
Nuno Antonio, Ana Almeida, and Luis Nunes for Data in Brief, Volume 22, February 2019.

Purpose: Obtain a clean dataset that can be used to predict the probability of hotel
reservation cancellations.

Materials: Included are the initial dataset, the preprocessed dataset, and the model
obtained by training the dataset with specific hyperparameters.

Model prediction: If you only want to use the model, you can skip to the end, where
you will find the pre-trained model and the possibility to add your own query.

Metrics: 85% Accuracy
You can find more metrics and the confusion matrix in the paper.
